# CARUS

## OVERVIEW

Carus Recycling is a decentralized recycling platform that allows users to get incentivized through the Celo dollar (cUSD) by scheduling waste pick-ups and drop-offs effortlessly for recycling. The company's mission is to transform the way the world recycles and disposes of waste, transitioning toward a truly circular economy.

## KEY OFFERINGS
- ### Effortless Scheduling of Waste Pick-up and Drop-off:
Carus provides an intuitive platform for users to schedule convenient waste and recycling pickups from their homes or businesses. Users can input their location and select preferred pickup dates/times, streamlining the waste management process. The scheduling system optimizes pickup routes to improve efficiency and reduce environmental impact. Carus maintains a network of strategically located dropoff centers for users to conveniently deposit recyclables and waste, with locations mapped out based on user density and accessibility.

- ### Blockchain-Enabled Recycling Rewards:
Carus has developed a cryptocurrency-based rewards system that incentivizes responsible recycling behavior. Consumers can earn "The Celo Dollar (cUSD)" for properly sorting and depositing recyclables, which can then be redeemed or donated. 

- ### Closed-Loop Recycling Ecosystems:
Carus partners with local governments, businesses, and recycling facilities to build integrated recycling hubs that optimize material flows and minimize waste. These ecosystems incorporate reverse logistics, material processing, and end-product manufacturing to create a truly circular system.

- ### Sustainable Material Innovation:
Carus will have a research and development team that is continually exploring new recycling technologies and materials to reduce waste and environmental impact.
